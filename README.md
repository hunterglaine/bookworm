Bookworm
======

Bookworm is single-page application book database that gives avid readers the ability to search for, store, and categorize books from the GoogleBooks API into a personal bookshelf. Users can create and attend book club events, where all attendees can suggest books from their shelves, read further information about each suggested book, and ultimately vote on the book to read. The current vote count for each book is displayed to all attendees, and when voting is stopped, the book with the most votes is the one that remains.
